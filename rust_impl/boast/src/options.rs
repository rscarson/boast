/// Configuration for Bayesian Outlier-Aware Sequential Testing (BOAST)

/// Determines the parameters for the BOAST process, including confidence level, outlier probability,

/// # Fields
/// - `confidence`: The required confidence (`q`) in the initial number of iterations being above
/// - `outlier_probability`: The expected probability (`p`) of an outlier able to trigger a failure in any given point
/// - `belief_strength`: The strength of belief (`p_s`) in the initial outlier probability
/// - `pass_ratio`: The required ratio of passing tests to total tests for the overall test to be considered a pass
/// - `timeout`: An optional timeout duration for the entire BOAST process
